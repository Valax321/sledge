MVP to support the Source Engine:
--- Filesystem ---
* GameInfo parsing
	* Extract path information from the macros (e.g. |gameinfo_path|) - are these only used by > 2009 branches?

--- Geometry ---
* Displacements

--- Formats ---
* Ensure the VMF supported here is the same as source's version(s)
* VMT - at the very least just rendering $baseTexture would suffice
* VTF
* Source engine MDL versions - how many *are* there?
